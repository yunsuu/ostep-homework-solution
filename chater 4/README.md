Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is -S, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to SWITCH ON END, the system
will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH ON END), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?

```html
**python process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END**

Time        PID: 0        PID: 1           CPU           IOs

  6        BLOCKED         READY                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done         READY             1

 11           DONE       RUN:cpu             1

```

```html

  3        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  4        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  5        BLOCKED       RUN:cpu             1             1
  6        BLOCKED          DONE                           1
  7*   RUN:io_done          DONE             1
```

One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With -I IO RUN LATER, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (Run ./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH ON IO -I IO RUN LATER -c -p) Are system resources being effectively utilized?

**python process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p**

Now run the same processes, but with -I IO RUN IMMEDIATE set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?
